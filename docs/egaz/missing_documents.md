### Short-term Actions

6. **Develop Concept Note** - Retrospective concept document if not available
7. **Create Comprehensive Project Plan** - Expand beyond deployment plan
8. **Prepare Training Closure Report** - Document training completion and effectiveness
9. **Establish Tracking Logs** - Create Issue Tracker, Change Management Log, and Version Control Log

### Medium-term Actions

10. **Expand API Documentation** - Comprehensive API integration guide beyond HRIMS
11. **Prepare UAT Summary Report** - Consolidate existing UAT documents into summary
