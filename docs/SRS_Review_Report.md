---

#### ISSUE-SRS-003: Ambitious Performance Targets

**Category:** Feasibility
**Severity:** Minor
**Impact:** Low

**Description:**
Performance targets are ambitious but achievable with proper optimization:
- Login <1.5s (95th percentile) - requires database optimization, caching
- Dashboard <5s - requires API caching, lazy loading, query optimization

**Analysis:**
- **Login <1.5s:** Baseline ~650ms (DB 200ms + bcrypt 300ms + JWT 50ms + network 100ms), achievable with connection pooling and Redis caching
- **Dashboard <5s:** Estimated ~4s (header 500ms + widgets 2.4s + charts 1s), achievable with API caching and progressive loading

**Recommendation:**
Accept targets with commitment to performance optimization:
- Database indexing (all search fields)
- Redis caching (employee counts 60s TTL, request counts 30s TTL)
- Next.js code splitting and lazy loading
- CDN for static assets
- PostgreSQL connection pooling

**Mitigation:**
- Performance testing during development
- Continuous monitoring with performance budgets
- Optimization sprints if targets not met

**Status:** Accepted - Performance optimization prioritized in development plan

---

#### ISSUE-SRS-004: Requirements Traceability Matrix Not Included

**Category:** Traceability
**Severity:** Minor
**Impact:** Low

**Description:**
SRS does not include a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) linking each requirement to:
- Source business need
- Design element
- Test case(s)
- Implementation status

**Current Traceability:**
- ✅ Requirements numbered (FR[module].[number], NFR[category].[number])
- ✅ Priority assigned (Critical, High, Medium)
- ✅ Source documents referenced (Section 1.4)
- ❌ RTM not included

**Recommendation:**
Accept as-is. RTM is typically maintained as a separate living document in the project management tool, not embedded in SRS. Current SRS has sufficient traceability through:
- Requirement IDs (FR1.01, NFR1.1, etc.)
- Priority levels
- Module organization
- Source document references

RTM will be maintained separately in project tracking system linking:
- Requirement ID → User Story → Design → Test Case → Implementation Status

**Status:** Accepted - RTM maintained separately in project management tool

---

#### ISSUE-SRS-005: Translation Strategy Not Detailed

**Category:** Usability
**Severity:** Minor
**Impact:** Medium

**Description:**
Duplicate of ISSUE-SRS-001 (bilingual support). Translation strategy for UI strings, error messages, validation messages, and email templates not detailed.

**Recommendation:**
Same as ISSUE-SRS-001 - add implementation note specifying translation file management, i18n library, and fallback behavior.

**Status:** Open - Recommend adding implementation note

- **Status:** Implementation improvement, should be reflected in SRS update

**OBS-NEU-003: No Automated Testing Specified**
- SRS specifies code coverage target (80%) but no testing framework
- Current approach: Comprehensive manual UAT (244 scenarios, 96.7% pass rate)
- Observation: Manual testing successful but not sustainable long-term
- Recommendation: Add automated testing framework (Jest/Vitest, Playwright) in post-launch enhancement
- **Note:** This will be addressed in Code Review Report (Phase 3)

**OBS-NEU-004: AI Complaint Rewriting Not in Original SRS**
- Enhancement added during development (Google Genkit AI)
- Not a requirement violation - it's an enhancement
- Impact: Positive - helps employees write better, more professional complaints
- Recommendation: Document in SRS revision history as enhancement added

**OBS-NEU-005: Background Job Queue Not Explicitly Specified**
- Redis/BullMQ background job processing implemented for HRIMS bulk sync
- Not explicitly in SRS but implied by "HRIMS integration capability" requirement
- Impact: Positive - prevents timeout on bulk operations (5000+ employee sync)
- Recommendation: Document as implementation detail supporting HRIMS integration requirement
