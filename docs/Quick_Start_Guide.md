#### Q: Can I edit a request after submission?

**A:** No. Once submitted, requests cannot be edited. If you need to make changes, contact the approver or submit a new request.

#### Q: I submitted the wrong document. What should I do?

**A:** Contact the approver immediately via your institution's communication channel. They may reject the request, and you can resubmit with correct documents.

#### Q: Why is the status in Swahili?
